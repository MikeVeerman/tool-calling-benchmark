To write a Python script that checks the weather using an API, you'll typically need an API key from a weather service like **OpenWeatherMap**, **WeatherAPI**, or **AccuWeather**. Here\u2019s a general example using **OpenWeatherMap** as the weather API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (sign up for a free account).\n2. Install the `requests` library if you haven\u2019t already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"main\"]\n        weather_description = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = current_weather[\"temp\"]\n        humidity = current_weather[\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = current_weather[\"wind_speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {weather_description}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"Paris\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nget_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n1. **API Request**: The script sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.\n2. **Response Handling**: It checks if the request was successful (status code 200) and extracts relevant weather data.\n3. **Output**: Prints the weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n\n---\n\n### Example Output\nIf you run this script with `city=\"Paris\"` and a valid API key, you might see:\n```\nWeather in Paris:\nDescription: scattered clouds\nTemperature: 15\u00b0C\nHumidity: 65%\nWind Speed: 3.2 m/s\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- You can change the units to `\"imperial\"` for Fahrenheit or `\"metric\"` for Celsius.\n- If you want to fetch weather for multiple cities, you can loop through a list of cities.",

Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = data[\"wind\"][\"speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {current_weather}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"London\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nget_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n1. **API Request**: The script sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.\n2. **Response Handling**: It checks if the request was successful (status code 200) and extracts relevant weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.\n3. **Output**: Prints the weather details for the given city.\n\n---\n\n### Example Output\nIf you run this script with `city=\"London\"` and a valid API key, you might see:\n```\nWeather in London:\nDescription: scattered clouds\nTemperature: 15.2\u00b0C\nHumidity: 65%\nWind Speed: 3.1 m/s\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- You can change the `units` parameter to `\"imperial\"` for Fahrenheit or `\"metric\"` for Celsius.\n- If you want to fetch weather for multiple cities, you can loop through a list of cities.",

        "raw_content": "Yes! To write a Python script that checks the weather using an API, you'll typically need an API key from a weather service like **OpenWeatherMap**, **WeatherAPI**, or **AccuWeather**. Here\u2019s a general example using **OpenWeatherMap** as an example API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (sign up for a free account).\n2. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = data[\"wind\"][\"speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {current_weather}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = input(\"Enter the city name: \")\nget_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n1. The script uses the `requests` library to call the OpenWeatherMap API.\n2. You provide the city name and your API key.\n3. The script fetches and displays:\n   - Current weather description (e.g., \"scattered clouds\").\n   - Temperature in Celsius (or Fahrenheit if you change `units`).\n   - Humidity.\n   - Wind speed.\n\n---\n\n### Example Output\n```\nEnter the city name: Paris\nWeather in Paris:\nDescription: scattered clouds\nTemperature: 15.2\u00b0C\nHumidity: 72%\nWind Speed: 3.4 m/s\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- If you want to use a different API, adjust the `base_url` and parameters accordingly.\n- For more details, check the [OpenWeatherMap API documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api).",

Trains from Brussels to Bruges take about **30\u201345 minutes**. You can check real-time schedules on platforms like [SNCB](https://www.sncb.be) or [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com).\n- **Cycling**: Bruges is very bike-friendly, and the route from Brussels to Bruges is about **50\u201360 km** (one way). It takes roughly **5\u20136 hours** depending on your pace. The route is mostly flat and well-marked, but weather conditions (rain, wind) can affect comfort.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- If you have **limited time** and want a **quick trip**, the train is likely the best choice.\n- If you **enjoy cycling**, have **plenty of time**, and prefer a scenic route, cycling could be a great experience.\n\nWould you like me to help you find a train schedule or more details about the cycling route?

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `city` to the city you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- The script uses the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides free access for limited usage.\n- You can modify the script to fetch more details (e.g., forecast, 5-day weather) by adjusting the API endpoint and parsing the response accordingly.\n- If you want to use a different API, let me know, and I can adapt the script!",

Here\u2019s a general example using **OpenWeatherMap** as the weather API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (sign up for a free account).\n2. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script Example\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        return {\n            \"city\": city,\n            \"description\": weather,\n            \"temperature\": temperature,\n            \"humidity\": humidity\n        }\n    else:\n        return {\"error\": \"City not found or API error\"}\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n    CITY = \"Paris\"\n\n    weather_data = get_weather(CITY, API_KEY)\n    print(f\"Weather in {weather_data['city']}:\")\n    print(f\"Description: {weather_data['description']}\")\n    print(f\"Temperature: {weather_data['temperature']}\u00b0C\")\n    print(f\"Humidity: {weather_data['humidity']}%\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Script\n1. Replace `\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `\"Paris\"` to the city you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- The script uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** with the `2.5/weather` endpoint.\n- The `units` parameter can be set to `\"metric\"` (Celsius) or `\"imperial\"` (Fahrenheit).\n- If you want to check the weather for multiple cities, you can loop through a list of cities.",

Here are a few things you should know about Brussels for tomorrow:\n\n### General Information\n- **Time Zone**: Brussels is in the **CET (Central European Time)**, which is **UTC+1**. Since it's February 15, 2026, Brussels will be observing **Central European Winter Time (CET)**. If you're in a timezone that's behind Brussels by 1 hour (like most of Europe), you'll want to adjust your watch accordingly.\n\n### Transportation\n- **Metro/Tram**: Brussels has an extensive public transport system. If you're arriving by train, the **Brussels-Midi/Zuid (Main Station)** is the main hub. You can use the **STIB/MIVB** app to navigate the metro, trams, and buses.\n- **Airport**: If you're arriving by plane, the nearest airport is **Brussels Airport (BRU)**, which is well-connected to the city center by metro (Line 2 from BRU to Zaventem, then transfer to Line 1 or 5 to reach the city center).\n\n### Must-See Attractions\n- **Grand Place (Grote Markt)**: The iconic square in the heart of Brussels, surrounded by historic buildings.\n- **Manneken Pis**: A famous small statue of a urinating boy, often dressed in costumes.\n- **Atomium**: A famous landmark built for the 1958 World Expo.\n- **Sablon District**: Known for its antique shops and beautiful architecture.\n- **Belgian Waffles & Chocolate**: Brussels is famous for its waffles (try a *Li\u00e8ge waffle* for extra crispiness) and chocolate. Don\u2019t miss **Neuhaus** or **Pierre Marcolini** for high-quality chocolate!\n\n### Food and Drink\n- **Belgian Beer**: Brussels is near the Belgian beer regions. Try a local brewery like **Delirium Caf\u00e9** or **Brasserie de l\u2019Anvers**.\n- **Fries**: Belgian fries are crispy and served with mayo. Try **Fritland** or **Fritland\u2019s Secret**.\n- **Must-Try Dishes**: Don\u2019t forget to try a *moules-frites* (mussels with fries) or a *stoofvlees* (beef stew).\n\n### Cultural Tips\n- **Language**: French and Dutch are the official languages. While many people in Brussels speak English, learning a few French phrases (*Bonjour*, *Merci*, *S\u2019il vous pla\u00eet*) will be appreciated.\n- **Safety**: Brussels is generally safe, but keep an eye on your belongings in crowded areas, especially near tourist spots.\n\n### Weather\nWould you like me to check the weather for Brussels tomorrow?

To write a Python script that checks the weather using an API, you'll typically need an API key from a weather service like **OpenWeatherMap**, **WeatherAPI**, or **AccuWeather**. Here's a basic example using **OpenWeatherMap** as an example API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (sign up for free).\n2. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = data[\"wind\"][\"speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {current_weather}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"Paris\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nget_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Script\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `city` to the location you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- If you want to use a different weather API, you'll need to adjust the `base_url` and the parameters accordingly.\n- Always handle API rate limits and errors gracefully in production code.",

Don\u2019t hesitate to use it!\n\n### **Transportation**\n- **Public Transport**: Brussels has an excellent public transport system (STIB/MIVB). Get an **STIB ticket** (or a **Mobilis card**) for buses, trams, and metro. The **metro is very efficient** and covers most of the city.\n- **Trains**: If you're arriving by train, check if your station is near a major transport hub like **Gare du Midi (Midi)** or **Gare Centrale (Central)**. From there, you can easily take the metro or a taxi.\n- **Taxis/Uber**: Taxis are available, but Uber is not officially licensed in Brussels. You can use **Bolt** or **Free Now** instead.\n\n### **Attractions**\n- **Grand Place (Grand Place)**: The iconic square in the heart of Brussels. It\u2019s beautiful year-round, but it\u2019s especially stunning in winter.\n- **Manneken Pis**: A famous statue that\u2019s often dressed in costumes.

Trains are comfortable and reliable, but they can take longer depending on connections. The journey from Brussels takes about 30-40 minutes, while from Ghent, it\u2019s around 15-20 minutes.\n- **Cycling:** If you're within a reasonable distance (e.g., under 10 km) and the weather is good, cycling is a great option. Bruges is very bike-friendly, with dedicated bike lanes. However, if you're coming from a farther location, cycling might be time-consuming and less comfortable.\n\nWould you like me to check the approximate travel time from your current location to Bruges by train or cycling? If so, please share your starting city or location!",

To write a Python script that checks the weather using an API, you'll typically need an API key from a weather service like **OpenWeatherMap**, **WeatherAPI**, or **AccuWeather**. Here\u2019s a general example using **OpenWeatherMap** as an example API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (sign up for a free account).\n2. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script Example\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        return {\n            \"city\": city,\n            \"description\": weather,\n            \"temperature\": temperature,\n            \"humidity\": humidity\n        }\n    else:\n        return {\"error\": \"City not found or API error\"}\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n    CITY = \"Paris\"\n\n    weather_data = get_weather(CITY, API_KEY)\n    print(f\"Weather in {weather_data['city']}:\")\n    print(f\"Description: {weather_data['description']}\")\n    print(f\"Temperature: {weather_data['temperature']}\u00b0C\")\n    print(f\"Humidity: {weather_data['humidity']}%\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `CITY` to the city you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- The script uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** for simplicity. If you want to use a different API, you'll need to adjust the `base_url` and parameters accordingly.\n- Always handle API errors gracefully in production code (e.g., invalid API key, network issues).\n- Some free APIs have rate limits; check the API's documentation for details.",

Here are a few things you should know about Brussels for tomorrow:\n\n### **General Tips for Brussels**\n1. **Transportation**:\n   - Brussels has an excellent public transport system (STIB/MIVB). Get an **STIB ticket** (or a **STIB Pass**) for unlimited travel on trams, buses, and metro.\n   - The metro is efficient and covers most of the city center.\n   - If you're arriving by train, the **Gare du Midi (Mid) or Gare du Nord** are the main stations.\n\n2. **Language**:\n   - Brussels is officially bilingual (French and Dutch). While many people speak English, learning a few French phrases (e.g., *\"Bonjour\"*, *\"Merci\"*) will be appreciated.\n\n3. **Currency**:\n   - Brussels uses the **Euro (\u20ac)**. Make sure to have some cash for small purchases or street food.\n\n4. **Food & Drink**:\n   - Must-try dishes: **Moules-frites** (mussels with fries), **Waffles** (especially Belgian waffles), **Fries with mayo**, and **Belgian beer** (try a local craft beer or a classic like Stella Artois).\n   - Avoid tap water; drink bottled water.\n\n5. **Safety**:\n   - Brussels is generally safe, but keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas like Grand Place or public transport.\n\n6. **Attractions**:\n   - **Grand Place (Grand Place)**: The iconic square with stunning Gothic and Baroque buildings.\n   - **Manneken Pis**: A famous small statue that urinates (often dressed in costumes).\n   - **Atomium**: A futuristic landmark built for the 1958 World Expo.\n   - **Magritte Museum**: Dedicated to the surrealist artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte.\n\n7. **Weather Tomorrow (2026-02-15)**:\n   Let me check the current weather for Brussels to give you an accurate forecast.",

Install the `requests` library if you haven\u2019t already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = data[\"wind\"][\"speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {current_weather}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"London\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nget_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Script\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `city` to the location you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- The script uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** with the `metric` unit for temperature (change to `imperial` for Fahrenheit).\n- If you want to use a different API, you\u2019ll need to adjust the `base_url` and parameters accordingly.\n- Always handle API rate limits and errors gracefully in production code.",

Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"main\"]\n        weather_description = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = current_weather[\"temp\"]\n        humidity = current_weather[\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = current_weather[\"wind_speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {weather_description}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"Paris\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nget_weather(city, api_key)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Script\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `city` to the city you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- The script uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** with the `metric` unit (Celsius). Change `units` to `\"imperial\"` if you want Fahrenheit.\n- The API has rate limits; avoid making too many requests in a short time.\n- If you want to use a different weather API, you'll need to adjust the `base_url` and parameters accordingly.",

Trains are comfortable and reliable, but they can be time-consuming depending on your starting point. You can check real-time schedules and prices using apps like **De Lijn** (Belgium) or **SNCF Connect** (France).\n- **Cycling**: Bruges is a very bike-friendly city. The route from Brussels (the closest major city) to Bruges is about **50 km** and takes roughly **1 hour and 15 minutes** on a bike. However, the route can be quite hilly, especially if you're coming from Brussels.

To write a Python script that checks the weather using an API, you'll typically need an API key from a weather service like **OpenWeatherMap**, **WeatherAPI**, or **AccuWeather**. Here\u2019s a general example using **OpenWeatherMap** as the weather API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get a free API key.\n2. **Install the `requests` library** (if not already installed):\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script to Fetch Weather Data\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(api_key, city):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        current_weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        wind_speed = data[\"wind\"][\"speed\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}:\")\n        print(f\"Description: {current_weather}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n        print(f\"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: {data.get('message', 'Unknown error')}\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"London\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nget_weather(api_key, city)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n1. **API Request**: The script sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.\n2. **Response Handling**: It checks if the request was successful (status code 200) and extracts relevant weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.\n3. **Output**: Prints the weather details for the given city.\n\n---\n\n### Example Output\nIf you run this script with `city=\"London\"` and a valid API key, you might see:\n```\nWeather in London:\nDescription: scattered clouds\nTemperature: 15.2\u00b0C\nHumidity: 65%\nWind Speed: 3.1 m/s\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n- You can change the units to `\"imperial\"` for Fahrenheit or `\"metric\"` for Celsius.\n- If you want to fetch weather for multiple cities or use a different API, you can modify the script accordingly.",
