Since it's February, daylight saving time is not in effect, so it's currently **CET (UTC+1)**.\n- **Weather**: Since it's winter, temperatures are likely to be cold, around **0\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C (32\u00b0F to 41\u00b0F)**.

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `city` to the location you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling for API failures.\n- **Units**: Use `\"units\": \"imperial\"` if you want temperature in Fahrenheit.\n- **Other APIs**: You can replace `base_url` and the parameters with those from another weather API (e.g., `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json`).",

Here are a few things you should know about Brussels for your visit tomorrow, February 8, 2026:\n\n---\n\n### **General Tips for Brussels**\n1. **Transportation**:\n   - Brussels has an excellent public transportation system, including trams, buses, and the metro. Get an **Ic\u00f4ne card** (reusable ticket) for unlimited travel.\n   - The metro is efficient and covers most major attractions.\n   - If you're arriving by train, the **Central Station (Gare Centrale)** is a great starting point.\n\n2. **Language**:\n   - French and Dutch are the official languages. English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas, but learning a few basic phrases in French or Dutch (\"Bonjour,\" \"Merci,\" \"D\u00e9sol\u00e9\") will be appreciated.\n\n3. **Currency**:\n   - The official currency is the Euro (\u20ac). Withdraw some cash or use a card for convenience.\n\n4. **Attractions**:\n   - **Grand Place**: The iconic square in the heart of Brussels, surrounded by beautiful historic buildings.\n   - **Manneken Pis**: A famous statue that urinates (or poses) and is a must-see.\n   - **Atomium**: A unique landmark built for the 1958 World Expo. You can visit the museum inside.\n   - **Sablon District**: Known for its beautiful churches and antique shops.\n   - **Belgian Waffles and Chocolate**: Don\u2019t miss trying a traditional Belgian waffle or a piece of chocolate from a local shop!\n\n5. **Food and Drink**:\n   - Brussels is famous for its **waffles** (try a Li\u00e8ge waffle for extra crispiness).\n   - Don\u2019t forget to try **Belgian beer** (like Trappist beers from Bruges or Brussels brands like Duvel, Rodenbach, or Leffe).\n   - Belgian fries are also a must\u2014ask for mayo or ketchup!\n\n6. **Safety**:\n   - Brussels is generally safe, but keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas like tourist spots.\n\n7. **Weather**:\n   - Brussels can be quite cold in February, so pack warm clothing, including a coat, gloves, and a scarf. The weather might be chilly and overcast, but it\u2019s not uncommon to have sunny spells. Let me check the current weather for you!",

This could affect whether cycling is a good option.\n\nFor now, I can provide some general information:\n\n- **Train**: Bruges is well-connected by train from major cities like Brussels, Ghent, and Antwerp. Trains are comfortable and reliable, but they can be slower than cycling if you're traveling from a nearby area.\n- **Cycling**: Bruges is a very bike-friendly city, and many people cycle from nearby towns like Ghent or Bruges itself. However, the weather and road conditions are important factors.\n\nCould you clarify your starting location and any other preferences? I can also check the weather for your location if you provide it.",

To write a Python script that checks the weather using an API, you'll typically need an API key from a weather service like **OpenWeatherMap**, **WeatherAPI**, or **AccuWeather**. Here\u2019s a general example using **OpenWeatherMap** as the weather API:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Get an API key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get a free API key.\n2. **Install the `requests` library** (if you don\u2019t have it already):\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Python Script Example\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(api_key, city):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n\n    params = {\n        \"q\": city,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"metric\"  # Use \"metric\" for Celsius, \"imperial\" for Fahrenheit\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        weather = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n        return {\n            \"city\": city,\n            \"description\": weather,\n            \"temperature\": temperature,\n            \"humidity\": humidity\n        }\n    else:\n        return {\"error\": \"City not found or API error\"}\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\ncity = \"Paris\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nweather_data = get_weather(api_key, city)\nprint(weather_data)\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Script\n1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n2. Change `city` to the city you want to check.\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   python weather_script.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Output Example\nIf successful, the script will return something like:\n```json\n{\n    \"city\": \"Paris\",\n    \"description\": \"scattered clouds\",\n    \"temperature\": 15.5,\n    \"humidity\": 72\n}\n```\n\n---",
