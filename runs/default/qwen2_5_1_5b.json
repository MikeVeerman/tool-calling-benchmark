For example, I can call `get_weather(city=\"Antwerp\")` to check the weather in Antwerp.\n\n2. File Searcher - I use this function to search through the project directory for files matching a particular pattern or filename. You can provide a file pattern like '*.py' and I'll help you find all Python files in the project.\n\n3. Meeting Scheduling - This tool enables me to schedule meetings with specified attendees at given times using ISO 8601 format for time. It's useful when planning team sessions, such as `schedule_meeting(title=\"Weekly Standup\", time=\"2023-04-05T10:00:00Z\", attendees=[\"alice@example.com\", \"bob@example.com\"])`.\n\nEach of these tools is provided to assist you with tasks in a structured and efficient manner.",

To run this script, save it as a Python file (e.g., `weather_check.py`) and execute it using Python interpreter.\n\nMake sure to handle exceptions in production code for better error handling:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city):\n    # Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key\n    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?\"\n    \n    complete_url = f\"{base_url}appid={api_key}&q={city}\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(complete_url)\n    data = response.json()\n    \n    if data['cod'] != '404':\n        main_data = data['main']\n        temperature = main_data['temp']\n        humidity = main_data['humidity']\n        wind_speed = data['wind']['speed']\n        \n        weather_desc = data['weather'][0]['description']\n        \n        return f\"Temperature: {temperature}K, Humidity: {humidity}%\\nWind Speed: {wind_speed}m/s\\nDescription: {weather_desc}\"\n    else:\n        return \"City not found.\"\n\n# Example usage\ncity_name = 'Antwerp'  # Change to your desired city name\nprint(get_weather(city_name))\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this script only returns the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
