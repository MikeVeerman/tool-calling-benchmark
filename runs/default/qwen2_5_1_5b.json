It allows matching patterns to find specific files based on a given Glob pattern, which could help in finding any related documents or scripts.\n\nLastly, scheduling meetings with attendees at predetermined times is handled by 'schedule_meeting', making it convenient for organizing virtual gatherings. To use this feature, you need to mention the meeting title, desired time (in ISO 8601 format), and list of emails addresses as the attendee information.\n\nPlease feel free to ask me any other query related to these functions or others I don't know about yet!",

Install `requests` if you haven't already:\n```sh\npip install requests\n```\n\n2. Create your script with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city):\n    url = f'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=your_api_key'\n    \n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n\n    if data['cod'] != 404:\n        weather_description = data['weather'][0]['description']\n        temperature = data['main']['temp'] - 273.15 # Convert Kelvin to Celsius\n        humidity = data['main']['humidity']\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}: {weather_description}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {temperature:.2f}\u00b0C\")\n        print(f\"Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n    else:\n        print(\"City not found!\")\n\n# Example usage\nget_weather('Antwerp')\n```\n\nReplace `'your_api_key'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. This script will then query the weather for 'Antwerp'. You can customize this to check any city you'd like.\n\nPlease note that an API key is required for accessing their services, and it's essential to replace `'your_api_key'` in the `url` variable with your own valid OpenWeatherMap API key.

Once signed in, you'll get your own key.\n\nFor demonstration purposes, I am assuming you have an OpenWeatherMap API token and know how to request data using Python's `requests` library. Below is a simple script that checks the weather for a city of your choice:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef check_weather(city):\n    api_key = 'your_openweathermap_api_token'\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        'q': city,\n        'appid': api_key,\n        'units': 'metric',\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        weather_data = response.json()\n        print(f\"City: {weather_data['name']}\")\n        print(f\"Weather: {weather_data['weather'][0]['description']}\")\n        print(f\"Temperature: {weather_data['main']['temp']}\u00b0C\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve the current weather for the city.\")\n\n# Replace 'your_city_name' with your actual city name\ncheck_weather('your_city_name')\n```\n\nJust replace `'your_openweathermap_api_token'` and `'your_city_name'` with your OpenWeatherMap API key and a specific city of interest. Remember, you need to sign up on OpenWeatherMap for this script to work.\n\nAlso note that the script uses `units: 'metric'`, which means it provides temperature in Celsius. If you want Fahrenheit or other units, you would need to adjust the parameters accordingly by adding `'units': 'imperial'`.\n\nPlease make sure your local Python environment has requests installed before running the script. You can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nThis is a basic demonstration of how you might use an external API like OpenWeatherMap within a Python script to retrieve weather data.",

If you're looking for a quick and easy answer without consulting any sources, you might choose either method with a 50/50 chance of being correct.\n\nHowever, please remember that the most accurate information would come from checking the day-to-day public transportation updates directly through your local city services or using an app like Google Maps.",

Write Python script that retrieves the current temperature using OpenWeatherMap API with the provided city name and API key.\n\nBelow is a sample script:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city, api_key):\n    base_url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?\"\n    complete_url = f\"{base_url}appid={api_key}&q={city}\"\n    response = requests.get(complete_url)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        weather_data = response.json()\n        main_data = weather_data['main']\n        temperature = main_data['temp'] - 273.15 # Convert Kelvin to Celsius\n        return temperature\n    else:\n        raise Exception('Error fetching the data')\n\n# Replace 'your_api_key' with your actual API key and 'city_name' with the city you're interested in.\napi_key = \"your_api_key\"\ncity_name = \"London\"  # Change this to your desired city\n\nweather_temp = get_weather(city_name, api_key)\nprint(f\"The current temperature in {city_name} is: {weather_temp:.2f}\u00b0C\")\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_api_key'` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap. The script checks if the response was successful and retrieves the temperature in Celsius.\n\nNow, run this Python script. You should get a console output showing the current temperature in degrees Celsius for the specified city. If there are no errors, you'll see something like \"The current temperature in London is: 12.56\u00b0C\". Adjust the `city_name` as per your choice.",

        "raw_content": "Sure! You can use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and retrieve data from a weather API. Here's a simple example of how you might accomplish this:\n\nFirst, install the required libraries:\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nThen create a Python script called `check_weather.py`. This script will fetch the current weather for your city using an OpenWeatherMap API.\n\nHere is what it could look like:\n\n1. Import necessary modules.\n2. Define a function to check the weather, taking a city name as input.\n3. Call this function with the desired city (e.g., 'Antwerp') and print out the result.\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n\ndef get_weather(city):\n    \"\"\"Retrieve current weather for a given city using OpenWeatherMap API.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Replace 'your_api_key' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key\n    api_key = \"your_api_key\"\n\n    base_url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}\"\n\n    response = requests.get(base_url)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        weather_data = response.json()\n        \n        # Extract and print temperature, conditions, etc.\n        temp = weather_data['main']['temp']\n        description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']\n\n        print(f\"The current weather in {city} is: {description}, with a temperature of {temp}K.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve data. Please check your city name and API key.\")\n\n# Example usage\nget_weather('Antwerp')\n```\n\nReplace `'your_api_key'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key for it to work correctly.\n\nThis script will fetch the current weather information for the specified city (in this case, 'Antwerp') using an open source weather API. Make sure you have the correct API key and replace placeholders like `city`, `API_KEY`, etc., according to how your actual OpenWeatherMap is configured.\n\nRemember that the `requests` library needs internet access to work properly. Also ensure that your script runs in a Python environment where it can import libraries, such as setting up a virtual environment or ensuring proper permissions are set for scripts execution.",

Define the function that will use the API for fetching weather data.\n3. Call this function with an appropriate argument, such as retrieving the current weather in a specific city.\n4. Print out the retrieved weather information.\n\nLet's start by defining our script:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_weather(city):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sends a request to a weather API and returns the current weather for the specified city.\n\n    Args:\n        city (str): The name of the city to check the weather in.\n        \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the current weather information including temperature, description, etc.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Call the 'get_weather' tool with our argument\n    response = requests.get(f'https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={city}')\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.json()\n    else:\n        raise Exception('Failed to retrieve weather data')\n\n# Example usage: Get the current weather in a specific city\ncity = 'Antwerp'\nweather_data = get_weather(city)\n\nprint(weather_data)\n```\n\nFor this script, you will need to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key. The `get_weather` function now calls an external tool called `requests`, which is commonly used for sending HTTP requests in Python.\n\nNow let's execute the script:\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n2. Navigate to the directory where you've saved this script.\n3. Run it using the following command:\n   ```\npython check_weather.py\n```\n\nThis should print out current weather information including temperature and description for the city you're checking (e.g., Antwerp).",
